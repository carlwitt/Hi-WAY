/******************************************************************************
 In the Hi-WAY project we propose a novel approach of executing scientific
 workflows processing Big Data, as found in NGS applications, on distributed
 computational infrastructures. The Hi-WAY software stack comprises the func-
 tional workflow language Cuneiform as well as the Hi-WAY ApplicationMaster
 for Apache Hadoop 2.x (YARN).
